# platformer

canvas based platform game engine.

This is me getting some much needed practice with classes. Check out my progress by clicking the above link. this uses arrow keys to move left or right, down to crouch, and space to jump.

Being a fan of 2d platform games for most of my life, I am intimently familiar with the mechanics of a 2d platformer, but I intentionally haven't researched any programming techninques for this type of game just to try to see what I can come up with on my own.
